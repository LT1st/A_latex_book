This boy is from the steppe.

### 1
I've speed most of my childhood in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. 
The scene of the steppe in my hometown keeps flashing back in my mind these days.  And it inspires me to make this album in memory of my past days.
These photographs represent some part of me.
To some extent, to read this book is to read about this boy.
