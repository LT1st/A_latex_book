{\LARGE This boy is from the steppe.}

This boy is from the steppe.
I've speed most of my childhood in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. 
The scene of the steppe in my hometown keeps flashing back in my mind these days.  
And it inspires me to make this album in memory of my past days.
These photographs represent some part of me. 
To some extent, to read this book is to read about this boy.

Although we have owned other kinds of critters through the years we had
never had chickens before, so this project was definitely one of
discovery. 
Thankfully, with sites like {\tt mypetchicken.com} and 
{\tt backyardchickens.com} to
guide us, as well as plenty of advice from friends and co-workers with
chickens, we're well on our way. This then, is the practical story of
how we went about it for the first month. Because you see, Solo Photo
Book Month doesn't wait for the full story of the chickens; there is
only time for the beginning of the story--all the photos have to be taken
in a 30 day period of time, and a book must be produced at the end.

And so, without further ado,

Before we brought anything home, I thought it might be a good idea to
figure out the where and how of a coop. It rains a fair bit here so I

We went back to Del's a few days later, but the clerk informed me that
she'd sold the remainder of the chicks that morning to a single buyer,
and that they wouldn't be getting any more until next spring! Yikes! How

        Next stop was Home Despot, er, Depot.  I had the beginnings of a plan in
        mind for a chicken coop.  My idea was to use a dog kennel as a starter
        coop.  HD had some inexpensive dog kennel kits, and I knew that with the
        galvanized steel I'd have something that could stand up to the rain, sun
        and termites.  I needed something to keep the chickens in, and predators
        out.

The 6x6x4 kennel seemed about the right size for 6 chickens, which is
what I was targeting.  My calculations were that six would yield us a
decent number of eggs per week.  After some reconsideration, we put the

{\LARGE Book Considerations}

Solo Photo Book Month (sofobomo.org) is a DIY project to make a photo
book in one month. All of the photos must be taken and the book laid 
out and processed into a PDF in 31 days. This is my second year
participating in the event, along with many other photographers all over
the world. 
Last year I did square format B\&W, so I was determined to do color and
some sort of rectangular format this year. I chose to go all landscape, 
even though it meant passing on some good verticals I had taken. Also,
last year was more of a series of portraits, and this year I was
determined to have the book tell more of a story. I struggled to find
something that would fit my tight schedule this year when the ``chicken
project'', which I'd had on the back burner, hit me as a good fit to
dovetail with SoFoBoMo.

{\LARGE Technical Details}

I was really pressed for time to get the book done in the requisite 30
days this year. I threw it together with snapshots taken with a Ricoh
GX100 camera. No post processing was done except for some quick levels
adjustments in the image editor GIMP.
{\em ImageMagick} was used to batch downsample the images for the web version
(144 dpi) or the book version (300 dpi). 
I designed the book using \LaTeX (with the wonderful {\em xetex} and
{\em xdvipdfmx}) for easier adjustments for dead tree publishing. 
The font used is Garamond. This book was made on Linux.
